# Cobble [![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/NicholasDJM/cc-programs)]([https://](https://github.com/NicholasDJM/cc-programs/blob/4d0a88f3413d2bbc00ad7866e7a45dde80822c7c/LICENSE))
Requires a mining turtle, and a chest block behind the turtle, and the cobble generator in front of it.

Program can be placed in the startup folder, as the turtle can orientate itself to continue mining by searching for the chest; which is why the chest must be behind the turtle, and the generator in front.

Will keep track of blocks mined as well.

## Installation
To install, run this command in a Mining Turtle:
```
pastebin run hGPMde8g
```
